# ZoomBoard

This is like a EDMBoard but with a bunch of subjects, ready to choose then using Selenium to open zoom with that Meeting URL for you! It's stupid how Zoom didn't think of this, but I did and I totally didn't go into depression because of this.

## Installation

Download the release and run

```
install.bat
```

to install Python and install all the packages, or do it manually like this while in the folder where the zoommeeting.py is located

```
cd python && py385.exe
cd..
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

While installing Python make sure you add it to PATH!

## Editing the csv file

Run

```
edit-csv.bat
```
or open subjects.csv with a text editor. Don't open it with Excel you will give yourself a hard time.

## Contributing

Anyone with the expertise can fork this project and make their own additions if you'd like. Or fix my spaghetti code
